<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) is responsible for sampling and assessing Illinois’ surface water quality according to the Clean Water Act (CWA) and identifying waterbodies that are not meeting water quality criteria. IEPA developed a multimetric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI; Karr et al. 1986) for lake assessments in 2015 – termed the Littoral ABC IBI. When calibrated appropriately, the index is responsive along a known disturbance gradient from least-disturbed (reference) to most-disturbed (stressed) lakes. IEPA wanted to validate the precision of the IBI by applying it to samples collected since calibration. However, in 2016, IEPA began testing a new sampling/processing technique (termed Composite F) that expedites sampling efforts and is cost-effective but differs from the technique used to calibrate the 2015 IBI. Thus, in addition to index validation, we assessed sampling method effects on index performance.</p>
<p>In this phase of work, the Littoral ABC IBI was applied to 44 Littoral ABC validation samples taken between 2013 – 2018 and performed well to discriminate between reference and stressed validation samples; thus, the index was validated for use on Littoral ABC samples. However, the index performed poorly when applied to 41 validation samples collected using IEPA’s new sampling method – Composite F. Consequently, IEPA decided to forgo index validation in favor of index recalibration as they preferred adopting the Composite F method to save on sample processing time and expenses.</p>
<p>Calibration of a new index consisted of metric selection and scoring, index compilation and performance testing, and final index selection. Indices were calibrated for application statewide as well as for each of the naturally distinct regions of Illinois (North, Central, South). IEPA decided upon a final index that was applicable statewide which means that lakes in each site class are to be evaluated using the same metrics and metric scoring formulae and assessed relative to least-disturbed reference lakes. The new Composite F IBI is comprised of five biological metrics found to be responsive to a general stressor gradient, ecologically meaningful, diverse in response mechanisms, and representative of four categories of metric responses (<strong>Table 1</strong>).</p>
<p>There are two limitations to the newly developed Composite F IBI that can be rectified in the future after additional monitoring efforts. First, the Composite F IBI was developed using both Littoral ABC IBI calibration data as well as data collected after the development of the Littoral ABC IBI. However, the majority of the data were virtually subsampled Littoral ABC samples rather than Composite F samples. Thus, the Composite F IBI is largely developed on the presumption that the virtual subsampling of Littoral ABC samples results in a similar taxa distribution as Composite F samples. Although we have confidence in the virtual subsampling routine, we recommend that whenever IEPA has accumulated a sufficiently large dataset that the Composite F IBI should be validated using only Composite F samples.</p>
<p>A second limitation of the Composite F IBI is related to the first in that there were no Composite F samples collected in the Central site class due to staffing limitations. The IBI’s performance was entirely evaluated using the virtually subsampled Littoral ABC samples. The aforementioned concern regarding the similarity of samples between sampling techniques should again be raised in this scenario wherein no Composite F samples were used when assessing the Central site class. The next steps for IEPA would be to prioritize sampling of Central lakes to ensure that the site class is represented when validating the IBI in the future.</p>

<div id="intended-application" class="section level2">
<h2>Intended application</h2>
<p>The IBI is intended to be applied to macroinvertebrate samples collected from freshwater lakes in Illinois using IEPA’s Composite F sampling method. Composite F is a composite method wherein IEPA samples the three littoral habitats (littoral fines, littoral plants, littoral cobble/woody debris) of a lake and then physically composites the samples together in the field. Samples are to be collected using either a 600-micron mesh size, 18x9-inch rectangular-frame, kick-net or a Ponar/Ekman grab and sampled between the dates of July 1 and October 1. Laboratory sample processing includes a random subsample to a target of 500 organisms. If you apply the IBI to samples that do not meet the criteria described above, results should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<h2>Input metrics and scoring formulae</h2>
<p>The working group decided upon a final index (the Composite F IBI) that was applicable statewide which means that lakes in each site class (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) are to be evaluated using the same metrics and metric scoring formulae and assessed relative to least-disturbed reference lakes. During calibration, the distributions of index scores in least-disturbed reference lakes were found to be different among site classes. Therefore, site-class-specific assessment thresholds were recommended based largely on balancing Type I and Type II error rates. Site-class-specific assessment thresholds recognize the inherent environmental differences among site classes and improve the ability for state biomonitoring programs to confidently implement management responses based on index scores.
